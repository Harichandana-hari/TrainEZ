### Project Description
TrainEZ is a **personal workout trainer app** that helps users achieve their fitness goals through **guided exercises** and **real-time feedback**. It uses **pose estimation** to analyze movements, provides **angle-based corrections**, and offers **customizable workout plans** tailored to individual goals. The app ensures users perform exercises correctly while tracking their progress for a seamless fitness experience.

### The Problem statement
TrainEZ solves the "I-think-I’m-doing-this-right-but-I’m-probably-not" problem. No more awkward squats or questionable pushups—our app uses real-time pose detection to guide you like a sassy gym buddy. It’s your personal trainer, comedian, and cheerleader all in one. Work out smarter, laugh harder, and avoid looking like a confused flamingo! 🚀💪

### The Solution
We’re turning workouts into a **real-time game**, where your squats get instant **feedback** like “Perfect!” or “Not Enough Depth!” 🎯  
Level up, earn badges, and compete with yourself or friends—because fitness should feel like a **challenge, not a chore!** 🏆💪  
With a virtual coach cheering you on, every rep counts—**so squat like a champ and crush your goals!** 🚀😎🔥
